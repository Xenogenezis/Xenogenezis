👋 Hey there, I'm @Xenogenezis! Not an alien, just a really enthusiastic Earthling. 🌍
👀 Currently obsessed with all things Earth. Yes, even the gravity!
🌱 Learning coding because my plants told me I need to branch out. 🌿
💞️ Seeking collaborators who won’t judge my questionable sense of humor.
📫 Reach me via carrier pigeon or, you know, just the usual internet stuff.
😄 Pronouns: Probably “he,” “she,” or “hey you!”
⚡ Fun fact: I once accidentally coded a bot that only spoke in cat memes. It was purr-fectly awful! 😹
